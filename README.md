> *Note: Source code is not available due to confidentiality, but this repo documents my contributions through design notes, screenshots, and implementation details.*

## Overview

During my time as a Junior Developer for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, I led the redesign and development of the organization's most popular educational game. My focus was to enhance accessibility, incorporate more educational elements, modernize the UI, and increase gamification for greater engagement.  
The finished project received an Accessibility User Score (AUS) of **100/100** as tested by Fable.

## My Contributions

- **UI Design:** Crafted a modern and intuitive user interface in Figma.
- **Game Design:** Enhanced interactivity by adding scores, a certificate of completion, and music/sound effects.
- **Accessibility:** Conducted comprehensive accessibility testing, including screen reader support and color contrast verification to AAA standards.
- **Led Development:** Built the game as a Drupal module for seamless integration with the OLA site and other Drupal environments as well as increased maintainability over original plugin.
- **Localization:** Produced complete French translations for bilingual accessibility and ensure UI styles accomodated translations.
